Stdout:                 If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
Stdout:                 in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
Stdout:                 specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
Stdout:                 flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
Stdout:                    - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
Stdout:                      during execution
Stdout:                    - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
Stdout:                      during linking
Stdout:                    - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
Stdout:                    - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Stdout:               If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
Stdout:               in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and

Stdout:               flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
Stdout:                  - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
Stdout:                    during execution

Stdout:                    during linking
Stdout:                  - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag

Stdout:                 flag during linking and do at least one of the following:

Stdout:                      during execution

Stdout:                    during execution

Stdout:               flag during linking and do at least one of the following:

Stdout:                    during execution

Stdout:               If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
Stdout:               in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and

Stdout:               flag during linking and do at least one of the following:

Stdout:                    during execution
